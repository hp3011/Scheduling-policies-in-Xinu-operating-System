Q1)  What are the advantages and disadvantages of each of the two scheduling policies? Also, give the advantages and disadvantages of the round robin scheduling policy originally implemented in Xinu.

1. Exponential Distribution Scheduler
Advantages
	1) Exponential Distribution scheduler uses a random generator function that calculates the random number, Based on this random number process are schedules. The order of all the processes is random.
	2) Random selection of the processes avoid starvation of any process.
Disadvantages
	1) If the random generator does not produce random results. If the value of the random number is low then a higher priority process is not selected, If the value of the random number is large then a smaller priority process will starve.

2. Linux-like Scheduler
Advantages
	1) process is scheduled based on the goodness value of the process, therefore this gives a fair chance to all processes.
Disadvantages
	1) Large overhead: At the start of every epoch, parameters like goodness, quantum are calculated.

3. Round Robin scheduling policy Xinu Scheduler
Advantages
	1) Process with the highest priority is preferred, and if more than one process has the highest priority then processes are scheduled in round-robin fashion.
	2) Faster because no calculation is involved.
Disadvantages
	1) There are chances of starvation of low priority process.



Q2)  Describe the way each of the schedulers affects the NULL process.

1. Exponential Distribution Scheduler
If there are no processes in the ready queue, then the only schedular will select the NULL process as the priority of the null process is 0.
2. Linux-like Scheduler
If there are no processes in the ready queue, then the NULL process is scheduled. 
3. Xinu Scheduler
The NULL process will not be scheduled.
